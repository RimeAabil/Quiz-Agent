##  What It Does

QuizAgent takes **educational content** and a **student profile**, then:

1. **Generates a personalized quiz**

   * Adapts to the student‚Äôs learning style, skill level, and strengths/weaknesses
   * Supports a customizable number of questions (minimum 8, default from configuration)
   * Uses AI (Groq-powered LLMs) to generate questions, options, correct answers, difficulty levels, and explanations

2. **Evaluates quiz answers**

   * Compares student answers to the correct ones
   * Calculates score, percentage, and detailed performance breakdown by topic and difficulty
   * Identifies strong and weak areas

3. **Generates personalized feedback**

   * Summarizes results with a friendly, student-centered message
   * Lists strengths, weaknesses, and learning insights
   * Can include explanations for incorrect answers

4. **Provides system configuration**

   * Loads settings from YAML files (`role.yaml`, `tasks.yaml`)
   * Offers question count limits and recommendations

## Example Usage

```python
from QuizAgent import QuizAgent

# Initialize
agent = QuizAgent()

# Sample student profile
profile = {
    'name': 'Alice',
    'learning_style': 'visual',
    'initial_level': 'beginner',
    'strengths': ['problem-solving'],
    'weaknesses': ['syntax']
}

# Generate quiz
quiz = agent.run_task(
    'generate_quiz',
    profile=profile,
    module_content="Python basics and control flow...",
    milestone="Chapter 1 Assessment",
    num_questions=10
)

# Evaluate quiz
evaluation = agent.run_task(
    'evaluate_quiz',
    user_answers=['A', 'C', 'B', ...],
    correct_answers=[q['correct_answer'] for q in quiz['questions']],
    questions_metadata=quiz['questions'],
    milestone="Chapter 1 Assessment"
)

# Get feedback
feedback = agent.run_task(
    'give_feedback',
    evaluation_results=evaluation,
    profile=profile,
    milestone="Chapter 1 Assessment"
)
```
